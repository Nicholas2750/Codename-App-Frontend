# spymaster-mobile-app

This is a mobile app that can be used to help somebody play the board game Codenames.
The app works by first asking the user to input the words that are in the game.
The words can be inputted either manually, by typing it, or by simply taking a photo of the board game.
After the word has been inputted and labeled accordingly to their respective team colours, the app will be able to generate words that acts as a clue for the words inputted.

Additionally, the functionality of this app is also reliant on a web API that we have created.
The repository for said web API can be found on: https://github.com/jasonxia17/spymaster-backend
